National Vaccine Management and distribution system

Designed and developed an objected oriented Java application for vaccine management system addressing vaccine distribution, financial management, vaccine inventory management and ordering system of vaccines at the state and local levels. 

•	Designed the application using Enterprise-Ecosystem model which provides role based access to 
the application.
•	Developed the system using Java Swing and DB4OUtil for database support.
•	Automated the process of ordering vaccines at local levels (Hospitals).
•	Integrated google maps to locate pharmacies, from where a vaccine order is requested.
•	Handled Billing and payment system according to the patient's insurance model.
•	Implemented Virtual Network (Events/ Roadside camps) wherein the user accounts are created 
and destroyed on the fly.
•	Used alerts and notifications to advertise the events happening across the hospitals.
•	Applied business intelligence techniques using data analysis to-
-Provide information of the percentage utilization and wastage of vaccine(s) by each 
hospital in a state. Hence determine hospital efficiency in terms of vaccine system.
-Track yearly consumption of vaccine and highlight percentage increase/decrease 
compared to previous years.
-Determine the vaccine(s) used by specific age brackets.
